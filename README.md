# Kmeans
The project presents the comparison between sequencial and parallel version of
the K-means clustering. The parallel code is implemented
using OpenMP in C++. <br /> My results indicate that the parallel
implementation has benefits regarding its speed and the
amount of data processed in the same quantity of time.
