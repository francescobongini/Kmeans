# Kmeans
The project presents the comparison between sequencial and parallel version of
the K-means clustering. The parallel code is implemented
using OpenMP in C++. <br />
Given a set of points, clustering analysis allows to classify groups in which every point is similar to the other in the same group.
My results indicate that the parallel
implementation has benefits regarding its speed and the
amount of data processed in the same quantity of time.  <br />
More informations can be found in the Paper folder.  <br />
You can find the code of the project in the Kmeans folder.
